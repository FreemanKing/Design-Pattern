/*
The Adapter Design pattern allows  incompatible classes to work together by converting the interface of one class into another

Example 1:
Consider , my socket(flat pin) is as per the Europe standard however my electric kettle have  US based pin(Round) so both are different all to gather however we want to make things  work , in that case adapter will come into the picture so we have to create one adapter which will help  both the interface to work together.
